  Paradigma: Digital Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease
  Toolbox is a Python software package designed for
  processing wearable sensor data to identify digital
  biomarkers associated with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). The
  toolbox facilitates the detection and analysis of sensor
  data, focusing on key gait and photoplethysmography (PPG)
  features that are critical for PD research. By leveraging
  the Time Series Data Format (TSDF), a unified and
  user-friendly format for handling both numerical data and
  metadata, Paradigma simplifies the process of working with
  raw binary sensor measurements alongside JSON-based
  metadata. The toolbox enables researchers to efficiently
  extract PD biomarkers, aiding in early diagnosis and
  monitoring. Future updates will introduce tremor detection
  and expanded feature extraction capabilities, further
  enhancing its utility for PD research and clinical
  applications.
