.. py:function:: resample_data(df: pandas.DataFrame, time_column: str, values_column_names: List[str], sampling_frequency: int, resampling_frequency: int, tolerance: float | None = None) -> pandas.DataFrame

   Resamples sensor data to a specified frequency using cubic interpolation.

   :param df: The input DataFrame containing the sensor data.
   :type df: pd.DataFrame
   :param time_column: The name of the column containing the time data.
   :type time_column: str
   :param values_column_names: A list of column names that should be resampled.
   :type values_column_names: List[str]
   :param sampling_frequency: The original sampling frequency of the data (in Hz).
   :type sampling_frequency: int
   :param resampling_frequency: The frequency to which the data should be resampled (in Hz).
   :type resampling_frequency: int
   :param tolerance: The tolerance added to the expected difference when checking
                     for contiguous timestamps. If not provided, it defaults to the tolerance specified in IMUConfig.
   :type tolerance: float, optional

   :returns: A DataFrame with the resampled data, where each column contains resampled values.
             The time column will reflect the new resampling frequency.
   :rtype: pd.DataFrame

   :raises ValueError: If the time array is not strictly increasing.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - Uses cubic interpolation for smooth resampling if there are enough points.
   - If only two timestamps are available, it falls back to linear interpolation.


.. py:function:: butterworth_filter(data: numpy.ndarray, order: int, cutoff_frequency: Union[float, List[float]], passband: str, sampling_frequency: int)

   Applies a Butterworth filter to 1D or 2D sensor data.

   This function applies a low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass Butterworth filter to the
   input data. The filter is designed using the specified order, cutoff frequency,
   and passband type. The function can handle both 1D and 2D data arrays.

   :param data: The sensor data to be filtered. Can be 1D (e.g., a single signal) or 2D
                (e.g., multi-axis sensor data).
   :type data: np.ndarray
   :param order: The order of the Butterworth filter. Higher values result in a steeper roll-off.
   :type order: int
   :param cutoff_frequency: The cutoff frequency (or frequencies) for the filter. For a low-pass or high-pass filter,
                            this is a single float. For a band-pass filter, this should be a list of two floats,
                            specifying the lower and upper cutoff frequencies.
   :type cutoff_frequency: float or List[float]
   :param passband: The type of passband to apply. Options are:
                    - 'hp' : high-pass filter
                    - 'lp' : low-pass filter
                    - 'band' : band-pass filter
   :type passband: str
   :param sampling_frequency: The sampling frequency of the data in Hz. This is used to normalize the cutoff frequency.
   :type sampling_frequency: int

   :returns: The filtered sensor data. The shape of the output is the same as the input data.
   :rtype: np.ndarray

   :raises ValueError: If the input data has more than two dimensions, or if an invalid passband is specified.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   The function uses `scipy.signal.butter` to design the filter and `scipy.signal.sosfiltfilt`
   to apply it using second-order sections (SOS) to improve numerical stability.


.. py:function:: preprocess_imu_data(df: pandas.DataFrame, config: paradigma.config.IMUConfig, sensor: str, watch_side: str) -> pandas.DataFrame

   Preprocesses IMU data by resampling and applying filters.

   :param df: The DataFrame containing raw accelerometer and/or gyroscope data.
   :type df: pd.DataFrame
   :param config: Configuration object containing various settings, such as time column name, accelerometer and/or gyroscope columns,
                  filter settings, and sampling frequency.
   :type config: IMUConfig
   :param sensor: Name of the sensor data to be preprocessed. Must be one of:
                  - "accelerometer": Preprocess accelerometer data only.
                  - "gyroscope": Preprocess gyroscope data only.
                  - "both": Preprocess both accelerometer and gyroscope data.
   :type sensor: str
   :param watch_side: The side of the watch where the data was collected. Must be one of:
                      - "left": Data was collected from the left wrist.
                      - "right": Data was collected from the right wrist.
   :type watch_side: str

   :returns: The preprocessed accelerometer and or gyroscope data with the following transformations:
             - Resampled data at the specified frequency.
             - Filtered accelerometer data with high-pass and low-pass filtering applied.
   :rtype: pd.DataFrame

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - The function applies Butterworth filters to accelerometer data, both high-pass and low-pass.


.. py:function:: preprocess_ppg_data(df_ppg: pandas.DataFrame, ppg_config: paradigma.config.PPGConfig, start_time_ppg: str | None = None, df_acc: pandas.DataFrame | None = None, imu_config: paradigma.config.IMUConfig | None = None, start_time_imu: str | None = None) -> Tuple[pandas.DataFrame, pandas.DataFrame | None]

   This function preprocesses PPG and accelerometer data by resampling, filtering and aligning the data segments of both sensors (if applicable).
   Aligning is done using the extract_overlapping_segments function which is based on the provided start times of the PPG and IMU data and returns
   only the data points where both signals overlap in time. The remaining data points are discarded.
   After alignment, the function resamples the data to the specified frequency and applies Butterworth filters to both PPG and accelerometer data (if applicable).
   The output is two DataFrames: one for the preprocessed PPG data and another for the preprocessed accelerometer data (if provided, otherwise return is None).

   :param df_ppg: DataFrame containing PPG data.
   :type df_ppg: pd.DataFrame
   :param df_acc: DataFrame containing accelerometer from IMU data.
   :type df_acc: pd.DataFrame
   :param ppg_config: Configuration object for PPG preprocessing.
   :type ppg_config: PPGPreprocessingConfig
   :param imu_config: Configuration object for IMU preprocessing.
   :type imu_config: IMUPreprocessingConfig
   :param start_time_ppg: iso8601 formatted start time of the PPG data.
   :type start_time_ppg: str
   :param start_time_imu: iso8601 formatted start time of the IMU data.
   :type start_time_imu: str

   :returns: A tuple containing two DataFrames:
             - Preprocessed PPG data with the following transformations:
                 - Resampled data at the specified frequency.
                 - Filtered PPG data with bandpass filtering applied.
             - Preprocessed accelerometer data (if provided, otherwise return is None) with the following transformations:
                 - Resampled data at the specified frequency.
                 - Filtered accelerometer data with high-pass and low-pass filtering applied.
   :rtype: Tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame | None]

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - If accelerometer data or IMU configuration is not provided, the function only preprocesses PPG data.
   - The function applies Butterworth filters to PPG and accelerometer (if applicable) data, both high-pass and low-pass.
