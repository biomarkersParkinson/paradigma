  abstract = {Digital health technologies can provide continuous monitoring and objective, real-world measures of Parkinson's disease (PD), but have primarily been evaluated in small, single-site studies. In this 12-month, multicenter observational study, we evaluated whether a smartwatch and smartphone application could measure features of early PD. 82 individuals with early, untreated PD and 50 age-matched controls wore research-grade sensors, a smartwatch, and a smartphone while performing standardized assessments in the clinic. At home, participants wore the smartwatch for seven days after each clinic visit and completed motor, speech and cognitive tasks on the smartphone every other week. Features derived from the devices, particularly arm swing, the proportion of time with tremor, and finger tapping, differed significantly between individuals with early PD and age-matched controls and had variable correlation with traditional assessments. Longitudinal assessments will inform the value of these digital measures for use in future clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Background: With a progressively aging global population, the prevalence of Parkinson's Disease and dementia will increase, thus multiplying the healthcare burden worldwide. Sensing technology can complement the current measures used for symptom management and monitoring. The aim of this umbrella review is to provide future researchers with a synthesis of the current methodologies and metrics of sensing technologies for the management and monitoring of activities and behavioral symptoms in older adults with neurodegenerative disease. This is of key importance when considering the rapid obsolescence of and potential for future implementation of these technologies into real-world healthcare settings. Methods: Seven medical and technical databases were searched for systematic reviews (2018--2024) that met our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Articles were screened independently using Rayyan. PRISMA guidelines, the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews, and the Johanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews were utilized for the assessment of bias, quality, and research synthesis. A narrative synthesis combines the study findings. Results: After screening 1458 articles, 9 systematic reviews were eligible for inclusion, synthesizing 402 primary studies. This umbrella review reveals that the use of sensing technologies for the observation and management of activities and behavioral symptoms is promising, however diversely applied, heterogenous in the methods used, and currently challenging to apply within clinical settings. Conclusions: Human activity and behavioral recognition requires true interdisciplinary collaborations between engineering, data science, and healthcare domains. The standardization of metrics, ethical AI development, and a culture of research-friendly technology and support are the next crucial developments needed for this rising field.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder with complicated and disabling motor and non-motor symptoms. The complexity of PD pathology is amplified due to its dependency on patient diaries and the neurologist's subjective assessment of clinical scales. A significant amount of recent research has explored new cost-effective and subjective assessment methods pertaining to PD symptoms to address this challenge. This article analyzes the application areas and use of mobile and wearable technology in PD research using the PRISMA methodology. Based on the published papers, we identify four significant fields of research: diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring, predicting response to treatment, and rehabilitation. Between January 2008 and December 2021, 31,718 articles were published in four databases: PubMed Central, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and MDPI. After removing unrelated articles, duplicate entries, non-English publications, and other articles that did not fulfill the selection criteria, we manually investigated 1559 articles in this review. Most of the articles (45\%) were published during a recent four-year stretch (2018--2021), and 19\% of the articles were published in 2021 alone. This trend reflects the research community's growing interest in assessing PD with wearable devices, particularly in the last four years of the period under study. We conclude that there is a substantial and steady growth in the use of mobile technology in the PD contexts. We share our automated script and the detailed results with the public, making the review reproducible for future publications.},

  abstract = {Background               Wearable sensors have been used successfully to characterize bradykinetic gait in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), but most studies to date have been conducted in highly controlled laboratory environments.                                         Objective               This paper aims to assess whether sensor-based analysis of real-life gait can be used to objectively and remotely monitor motor fluctuations in PD.                                         Methods               The Parkinson@Home validation study provides a new reference data set for the development of digital biomarkers to monitor persons with PD in daily life. Specifically, a group of 25 patients with PD with motor fluctuations and 25 age-matched controls performed unscripted daily activities in and around their homes for at least one hour while being recorded on video. Patients with PD did this twice: once after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medication and again 1 hour after medication intake. Participants wore sensors on both wrists and ankles, on the lower back, and in the front pants pocket, capturing movement and contextual data. Gait segments of 25 seconds were extracted from accelerometer signals based on manual video annotations. The power spectral density of each segment and device was estimated using Welch's method, from which the total power in the 0.5- to 10-Hz band, width of the dominant frequency, and cadence were derived. The ability to discriminate between before and after medication intake and between patients with PD and controls was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out nested cross-validation.                                         Results               From 18 patients with PD (11 men; median age 65 years) and 24 controls (13 men; median age 68 years), {$\geq$}10 gait segments were available. Using logistic LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression, we classified whether the unscripted gait segments occurred before or after medication intake, with mean area under the receiver operator curves (AUCs) varying between 0.70 (ankle of least affected side, 95\% CI 0.60-0.81) and 0.82 (ankle of most affected side, 95\% CI 0.72-0.92) across sensor locations. Combining all sensor locations did not significantly improve classification (AUC 0.84, 95\% CI 0.75-0.93). Of all signal properties, the total power in the 0.5- to 10-Hz band was most responsive to dopaminergic medication. Discriminating between patients with PD and controls was generally more difficult (AUC of all sensor locations combined: 0.76, 95\% CI 0.62-0.90). The video recordings revealed that the positioning of the hands during real-life gait had a substantial impact on the power spectral density of both the wrist and pants pocket sensor.                                         Conclusions               We present a new video-referenced data set that includes unscripted activities in and around the participants' homes. Using this data set, we show the feasibility of using sensor-based analysis of real-life gait to monitor motor fluctuations with a single sensor location. Future work may assess the value of contextual sensors to control for real-world confounders.},

The shift to availability of raw accelerations has increased measurement accuracy, transparency, and the potential for data harmonization. However, it has also shifted the need for considerable processing expertise to the researcher. Many users do not have this expertise. The R package GGIR has been made available to all as a tool to convermulti-day high resolution raw accelerometer data from wearable movement sensors into meaningful evidence-based outcomes and insightful reports for the study of human daily physical activity and sleep. This paper aims to provide a one-stop overview of GGIR package, the papers underpinning the theory of GGIR, and how research contributes to the continued growth of the GGIR package. The package includes a range of literature-supported methods to clean the data and provide day-by-day, as well as full recording, weekly, weekend, and weekday estimates of physical activity and sleep parameters. In addition, the package also comes with a shell function that enables the user to process a set of input files and produce csv summary reports with a single function call, ideal for users less proficient in R. GGIR has been used in over 90 peer-reviewed scientific publications to date. The evolution of GGIR over time and widespread use across a range of research areas highlights the importance of open source software development for the research community and advancing methods in physical behavior research.},

We developed a method to isolate gait segments without these arm activities.                                         Methods               Wrist accelerometer and gyroscope data were collected from 25 individuals with PD and 25 age-matched controls while performing unscripted activities in their home environment. This was done after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medication (`pre-medication') and approximately one hour after intake (`post-medication'). Using video annotations as ground truth, we trained and evaluated two classifiers: one for detecting gait and one for detecting gait segments without other arm activities. Based on the filtered gait segments, arm swing was quantified using the median and 95th percentile range of motion (RoM). These arm swing parameters were evaluated in three ways: (1) the agreement between predicted and video-annotated gait segments without other arm activities, (2) the sensitivity to differences between PD and controls, and (3) the sensitivity to the effects of dopaminergic medication.                                         Results                                On the most affected side, the mean (SD) balanced accuracy for detecting gait without other arm activities was 0.84 (0.10) pre-medication and 0.88 (0.09) post-medication. The agreement between arm swing parameters of predicted and video-annotated gait segments without other arm activities was high irrespective of medication state (intra-class correlation coefficients: median RoM: 0.99; 95th percentile RoM: 0.97). Both the median and 95th percentile RoM were smaller in PD pre-medication compared to controls (median:                                                         \$\${\textbackslash}Delta = -18.80{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$                                                                     {$\Delta$}                         =                         -                         18                         .                                                    80                           {$\circ$}                                                                                                                          , 95\% CI [                                                         \$\$-\$\$                                            -                                                                          30.63,                                                         \$\$-\$\$                                            -                                                                          10.60],                 p                 {$<$} 0.001; 95th percentile:                                                         \$\${\textbackslash}Delta = -28.34{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$                                                                     {$\Delta$}                         =                         -                         28                         .                                                    34                           {$\circ$}                                                                                                                          , 95\% CI [                                                         \$\$-\$\$                                            -                                                                          38.26,                                                         \$\$-\$\$                                            -                                                                          18.18],                 p                 {$<$} 0.001), and smaller in pre- compared to post-medication (median:                                                         \$\${\textbackslash}Delta = -12.31 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$                                                                     {$\Delta$}                         =                         -                         12                         .                                                    31                           {$\circ$}                                                                                                                          , 95\% CI [                                                         \$\$-\$\$                                            -                                                                          21.35,                                                         \$\$-\$\$                                            -                                                                          5.59],                 p                 {$<$} 0.001; 95th percentile:                                                         \$\${\textbackslash}Delta = -19.04 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$                                                                     {$\Delta$}                         =                         -                         19                         .                                                    04                           {$\circ$}                                                                                                                          , 95\% CI [                                                         \$\$-\$\$                                            -                                                                          28.48,                                                         \$\$-\$\$                                            -                                                                          11.14],                 p                 {$<$} 0.001).

Motivation with regards to physical activity will entirely be communicated through the study specific Slow Speed smartphone app. Primary outcomes will be compliance expressed as longitudinal change in digital measures of physical activity (step count) measured using a Fitbit smartwatch. Exploratory outcomes entail retention rate, completeness of remote digital biomarker assessments, digital prodromal motor and non-motor features of PD, blood biomarkers and brain imaging markers. Using these biomarkers, we aim to develop a composite score (prodromal load score) to estimate the total prodromal load. An international exercise study with fellow researchers in the United States and United Kingdom are currently in preparation (Slow-SPEED). Our intention is to analyse overlapping outcomes combined where possible through a meta-analysis plan, to obtain insight on (determinants of) heterogeneity in compliance and possible efficacy across subgroups},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Wearable sensors can objectively and continuously monitor daily-life tremor in Parkinson's Disease (PD). We developed an open-source algorithm for real-life monitoring of PD tremor which achieves generalizable performance across different wrist-worn devices. We achieved this using a unique combination of two independent, complementary datasets. The first was a small, but extensively video-labeled gyroscope dataset collected during unscripted activities at home (               n               \,=\,24 PD;               n               \,=\,24 controls). We used this to train and validate a logistic regression tremor detector based on cepstral coefficients. The second was a large, unsupervised dataset (               n               \,=\,517 PD;               n               \,=\,50 controls, data collected for 2 weeks with a different device), used to externally validate the algorithm. Results show that our algorithm can reliably quantify real-life PD tremor (sensitivity of 0.61 (0.20) and specificity of 0.97 (0.05)). Weekly aggregated tremor time and power showed excellent test-retest reliability and moderate correlation to MDS-UPDRS rest tremor scores. This opens possibilities to support clinical trials and individual tremor management with wearable technology.},

Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Cardiac autonomic dysfunction is a prevalent yet underdiagnosed non-motor manifestation in Parkinson disease (PD), and difficult to monitor continuously. Wrist-worn photoplethysmography (PPG) allows for continuous pulse rate monitoring, with potential to measure cardiac autonomic dysfunction in PD. However, motion artifacts pose significant challenges. We propose a two-step approach to account for PPG motion artifacts, and explore the association between pulse rate characteristics and cardiac autonomic dysfunction in PD. Methods: In 444 people with PD, we used wrist PPG and accelerometer data, collected during two weeks, with a minimum average wear time of 22h/day. Step 1 filters low-quality segments based on PPG morphology using a logistic regression classifier. Step 2 removes remaining segments with periodic motion artifacts (e.g. introduced by tremor), which mimic pulse waves, by combining the PPG and accelerometer data. Pulse rates were estimated every 2s using the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution, with weekly aggregates calculated for resting (day, night) and maximum (day) pulse rates. We studied the effect of filtering on the pulse rate estimates and assessed the relationship between pulse rate aggregates and both subjective and objective autonomic dysfunction measures. Results: Median proportion of high-quality PPG data was 29.2\% [IQR: 24.0\% to 35.9\%] during the day, and 86.1\% [IQR: 79.3\% to 90.6\%] during the night. Proportions of high-quality PPG data were similar across different rest tremor severity and dyskinesia scores. However, filtering out periodic motion artifacts (step 2) reduced overestimation of the maximum HR in persons with mild or severe rest tremor. More symptoms of autonomic dysfunction were associated with a lower maximum pulse rate during the day ({$\beta$}:-0.17, 95\% CI: [-0.33, -0.00]), while resting pulse rate showed no association. No significant differences in pulse rate metrics were found between individuals with or without orthostatic hypotension. Conclusions: PPG-based heart rate estimation in PD improves when periodic motion artifacts are accommodated, representing an important step toward developing digital biomarkers of cardiac autonomic dysfunction.
