    "The function [detect_tremor](https://github.com/biomarkersParkinson/paradigma/blob/main/src/paradigma/tremor/tremor_analysis.py#:~:text=detect_tremor) uses a pretrained logistic regression classifier to predict the tremor probability (`pred_tremor_proba`) for each window, based on the MFCCs. Using the prespecified threshold, a tremor label of 0 (no tremor) or 1 (tremor) is assigned (`pred_tremor_logreg`). Furthermore, the detected tremor windows are checked for rest tremor in two ways. First, the frequency of the peak should be between 3-7 Hz. Second, we want to exclude windows with significant arm movements. We consider a window to have significant arm movement if `below_tremor_power` exceeds `config.movement_threshold`. The final tremor label is saved in `pred_tremor_checked`. A label for predicted arm at rest (`pred_arm_at_rest`, which is 1 when at rest and 0 when not at rest) was also saved, to control for the amount of arm movement during the observed time period when aggregating the amount of tremor time in Step 4 (if a person is moving their arm, they cannot have rest tremor)."
