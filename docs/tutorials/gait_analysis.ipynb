The classifier is a [random forest](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) trained on a dataset of people with PD performing a wide range of activities in free-living conditions: [The Parkinson@Home Validation Study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7584982/).
