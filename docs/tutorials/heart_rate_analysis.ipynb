    "This tutorial shows how to extract heart rate estimates using photoplethysmography (PPG) data and accelerometer data. The pipeline consists of a stepwise approach to determine signal quality, assessing both PPG morphology and accounting for periodic artifacts using the accelerometer. Based on the signal quality, we extract high-quality segments and estimate the heart rate for every 2 s using the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution. "

    "The first step after loading the data is preprocessing. This begins by isolating segments containing both PPG and IMU data, discarding portions where one modality (e.g., PPG) extends beyond the other, such as when the PPG recording is longer than the accelerometer data. After this step, the preprocess_ppg_data function resamples the PPG and accelerometer data to uniformly distributed timestamps, addressing the fixed but non-uniform sampling rates of the sensors. After this, a bandpass Butterworth filter (4th-order, bandpass frequencies: 0.4--3.5 Hz) is applied to the PPG signal, while a high-pass Butterworth filter (4th-order, cut-off frequency: 0.2 Hz) is applied to the accelerometer data.\n",
