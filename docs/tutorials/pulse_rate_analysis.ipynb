    "This tutorial shows how to extract pulse rate estimates using photoplethysmography (PPG) data and accelerometer data. The pipeline consists of a stepwise approach to determine signal quality, assessing both PPG morphology and accounting for periodic artifacts using the accelerometer. The usage of accelerometer is optional but is recommended to specifically account for periodic motion artifacts. Based on the signal quality, we extract high-quality segments and estimate the pulse rate for every 2 s using the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution.\n",

This begins by isolating segments containing both PPG and IMU data, discarding portions where one modality (e.g., PPG) extends beyond the other, such as when the PPG recording is longer than the accelerometer data. This functionality requires the starting times (`metadata_time_ppg.start_iso8601` and `metadata_time_imu.start_iso8601`) in iso8601 format as inputs. After this step, the preprocess_ppg_data function resamples the PPG and accelerometer data to uniformly distributed timestamps, addressing the fixed but non-uniform sampling rates of the sensors. After this, a bandpass Butterworth filter (4th-order, bandpass frequencies: 0.4--3.5 Hz) is applied to the PPG signal, while a high-pass Butterworth filter (4th-order, cut-off frequency: 0.2 Hz) is applied to the accelerometer data.\n",

    "The final step is to aggregate all 2 s pulse rate estimates using [aggregate_pulse_rate](https://github.com/biomarkersParkinson/paradigma/blob/main/src/paradigma/pipelines/pulse_rate_pipeline.py#:~:text=aggregate_pulse_rate). In the current example, the mode and 99th percentile are calculated. We hypothesize that the mode gives representation of the resting pulse rate while the 99th percentile indicates the maximum pulse rate. In Parkinson's disease, we expect that these two measures could reflect autonomic (dys)functioning. The `nr_pr_est` in the metadata indicates based on how many 2 s windows these aggregates are determined."
