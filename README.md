## Introduction
The Parkinsons Disease Digital Markers (ParaDigMa) toolbox is a Python
software package designed for processing passively collected wrist 
sensor data to extract digital measures of motor and non-motor signs
of Parkinson's disease (PD).  

Specifically, the toolbox contains three data processing pipelines: 
(1) arm swing during gait, (2) tremor, and (3) heart rate analysis.
Furthermore, the toolbox contains general functionalities for signal
processing and feature extraction, such as filtering, peak detection,
and spectral analysis. The toolbox is designed to be user-friendly and
modular, enabling researchers to easily extend the toolbox with new
algorithms and functionalities. The toolbox is accompanied by a set of
example scripts and notebooks for each domain that demonstrate how to use
the toolbox for processing sensor data and extracting digital measures.

It contains functionalities for processing the following sensor types:

- Inertial Measurement Units (accelerometer, gyroscope)
- Photoplethysmogram (PPG)

## More about ParaDigMa
The components of ParaDigMa are visually shown in the diagram below.

#### Processes
ParaDigMa can best be understood by categorizing the sequential processes:

| Process | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Preprocessing | Ensuring that the sensor data is ready for further processing | 
| Feature extraction | Creating features based on windowed views of the timestamps |
| Classification | Making predictions using developed and validated classifiers | 
| Quantification | Selecting specific features of interest |
| Aggregation | Aggregating the features at a specified time-level |

#### Domain requirements
ParaDigMa can be used to extract aggregations related to a single or multiple domain(s). Each domain has its specific data requirements. Strict requirements for the domain are marked by X, soft requirements (for some additional functionalities) are marked by O.

| | Gait | Tremor | Heart Rate |
|----------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| **Accelerometer** | X | | O | 
| **Gyroscope** | X | X | | 
| **PPG** | | | X |
