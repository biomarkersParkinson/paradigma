ParaDigMa is a Python package for processing time series data of wrist-worn sensors to quantify signs of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). It contains functionalities for processing the following sensor types:
* Inertial Measurement Units (accelerometer, gyroscope)
* Photoplethysmogram (PPG)

And analyses of the following motor and non-motor domains:
* Gait
* Tremor
* Heart Rate

## More about ParaDigMa
The components of ParaDigMa are visually shown in the diagram below.

![Pipeline Architecture](docs/source/_static/img/pipeline-architecture.png)

#### Processes
ParaDigMa can best be understood by categorizing the sequential processes:

| Process | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Preprocessing | Ensuring that the sensor data is ready for further processing | 
| Feature extraction | Creating features based on windowed views of the timestamps |
| Classification | Making predictions using developed and validated classifiers | 
| Quantification | Selecting specific features of interest |
| Aggregation | Aggregating the features at a specified time-level |

#### Domain requirements
ParaDigMa can be used to extract aggregations related to a single or multiple domain(s). Each domain has its specific data requirements. Strict requirements for the domain are marked by X, soft requirements (for some additional functionalities) are marked by O.

| | Gait | Tremor | Heart Rate |
|----------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| **Accelerometer** | X | | O | 
| **Gyroscope** | X | X | | 
| **PPG** | | | X |
